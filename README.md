# Atalar Programming Language
Atalar Programming Language(APL) is an enchanted logical programming language designed for Bilkent University Fall 2017 CS315 Course Project 2. It supports the following:
- truth values (e.g., true and false)
- constants, with names starting with a lower-case letter followed by any ASCII alphanumeric
- connectives (e.g., and, or, implies, negation, ...) for propositional calculus
- variables, with names starting with a capital letter followed by any ASCII alphanumeric.
- predicates (e.g., date) corresponding to function calls that return truth values
- predicate instantiations (e.g., date(cumhuriyet-bayrami, 29-10-2017)) corresponding to function calls
- an assignment operator ("=")
- selection (if-else) statements
- while loops (based only on propositional truth values)
- input/output statements with read/write keywords
- declarations (variables, constants etc.)
- predicate definitions as functions
- start point for execution (e.g, "start" if there are custom predicates, "go" if there is none)

Even though this was a course project, it is my OWN work and belongs to me & ONLY me (due to the non-existing support from my teammates)

In this directory, the parser for APL is provided. For more information, you can contact me here: beratbbicer@gmail.com

Cheers.
